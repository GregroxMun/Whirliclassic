	@description = Surplus AtMoCo pressure sensors from the city of Podbaston following the tragic venting of the city's atmosphere into space. They were previously used to measure air pressure in an attempt to control leaks in the cave ceiling. They have been repackaged and re-branded, and are now suitable for the analysis of other planetary atmospheres. Probodobodyne Inc and AtMoCo mandatory warning: warranty void if used in a leaky spacecraft.

	@description = The ZX-20 Experimental Electrified Cell is a small, experimental storage device for electricity. It just has one small problem: it slowly leaks electricity out of the system. As such, it can hold about 7 hours of charge before it is depleted. Less if there is a power drain. The director of electrical research mandates the following, unintelligable warning: THIS IS A MODDED PART. IT DOES NOT EXIST IN STOCK KSP. LOCATION: GameData/WhirligigWorld/Patches/TyloTechTree.cfg.
