	@description = The ZX-20 Experimental Electrified Cell is a small, experimental storage device for electricity. It just has one small problem: it slowly leaks electricity out of the system. As such, it can hold about 7 hours of charge before it is depleted. Less if there is a power drain. The director of electrical research mandates the following, unintelligable warning: THIS IS A MODDED PART. IT DOES NOT EXIST IN STOCK KSP. LOCATION: GameData/WhirligigWorld/Patches/TyloTechTree.cfg.
