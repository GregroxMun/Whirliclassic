{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = You record the crew's assessment of the situation.
		
		MesbinInSpaceHigh = The big gray oval of Mesbin, surrounded by the dots and circles of its moons, is quite the sight.
		MesbinInSpaceLow = Crew reporting in, from Space!
		MesbinInSpaceLow = The ground seems to crawl by compared to the more rapidly advancing star field in the background.
		
		Gramun = Things are Grey-t here.
		
		KermunInSpace = You look down at the blue world beneath you. You become thirsty.
		KermunInSpace = The world below is covered in brown, billowy land masses filled with deep blue oceans.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = You've recorded your observations about the situation.
		
		GramunSrfLanded = The dirt is a fine, dusty powder of apparently rounded particles which do not clump together. It is difficult to shuffle through the sand.
		
		KermunSrfLanded = The eerie blue sky is said to represent a breathable atmosphere, but you decide it best to keep your helmet on any way.
		KermunSrfSplashed = Just like Dawton Family's Pools and Recreational Water Systems back home.
		
		DermunSrfLanded = You search the sky for Mesbin. You suddenly feel small.
		
		Derminmus = Could it be... chocolate?
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = You Observe the Goo.
		default = Something just happened. You record what just happened.
		
		Mesbin = The goo starts spinning around into variations on oblate spheroid shape.
		
		DermunSrfLanded = The Goo seems to be less dense here.
		
		GramunInSpace = The Goo seems to occupy the volume of the entire container.
		
		InSpace = The Goo feels right at home here.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]:FINAL
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = You've collected a sample of the surface.
		default = You dig around in the surface a bit, find something interesting, and throw it into a sample container.
		default = You poke at the ground looking for some really cool rocks to take home.
		
		MesbinSrfLanded = The fine regolith seems to be a powder made of sharp bits of silicate, apparently pulverized by meteorite impacts.
		
		GramunSrfLanded = The fine powder flows out of your sample collector several times before you give up and decide to secure a nice rounded pebble.
		
		KermunSrfLanded = The dirt shows signs of organic material.
		
		KermunSrfSplashed = The sample rapidly increases the surface humidity of anything it comes into contact with.
		
		DerminmusSrfLanded = is no chocolat
		
		AdjarSrfLanded = The icy regions seem to be covered in recent snowfall. You chuck a snowball into your sample jar for later.
		
		AdjarSrfLanded = The brown dirt shows signs of rusted iron, beneath which is a hard grey surface.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = You exposed the material samples to the environment, taking notes of how it behaves.

}
@Experiment_Definition[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = Collected and recorded temperature data from the environment.
		
		DerbinSrfLanded = It's hotter than it should be. Water would boil here.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = Collected and recorded atmospheric pressure data from the surroundings.
		
		KermunSrfLanded = The pressure is very nearly the same as pressurized caverns and cities of Mesbin.
		
		DerbinSrfLanded = There's too much air here. We need to do something about it.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = Gathered precise acceleration data while subjecting the vessel to this situation.
		
		MesbinSrfLanded = Minor quakes are common here.
		
		DerbinSrfLanded = There's evidence of tectonic activity.
		
		YaltheSrfLanded = There's an erruption all the time on this world, and the sensors can pick them up.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = Recorded accurate measurements of gravitational forces in these conditions.
		
		Reander = The gargantuan mass of Reander is internally differentiated differently than expected.
		
		ReanderSrfLanded = Detailed observations of Reander's interior structure reveal a solidified world--but I guess you already figured that out.
		
		Lito = Lito's mass is significantly less than expected for such a massive world!
		
		SholInSpaceHigh = Kaywell and Shol compete for the sensor's attention
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = You run an Atmosphere Analysis, recording various measurements like temperature, pressure and atmosphere composition.
		
		ReanderFlying = Incredibly, Reander's atmosphere is rich in oxygen!
		
		KermunSrfLanded = The atmosphere is barely enough to support Kerbal life, but given that the oxygen exists at all it's worth considering where it came from.
	}

@@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[asteroidSample]]:FIRST
{
	RESULTS
	{
		default = You collect a sample of the asteroid.
		
		MesbinInSpace = The composition of the asteroid is similar to Mesbin's crust.
