			description = A rock in an extremely hyperbolic orbit passing Kaywell. It was about to be entered into the catalog by a particularly unimaginative astronomer as 'Hypervelocity Rock' when his intern stopped him. "No," he said, "this is not 'Hypervelocity Rock.'" The astronomer stared blankly and mildly annoyed at his intern. "This is Fasteroid."
