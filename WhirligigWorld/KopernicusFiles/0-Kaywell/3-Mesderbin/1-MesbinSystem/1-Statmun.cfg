			description = Statmun is a small but incredibly dense asteroid that found itself dragged into a stable Mesbin-Syncronous orbit above the equator. Simple calculations reveal that the moon must be made out of heavy, possibly radioactive elements, or else it would be ripped apart. As it is in a nearly perfect Messyncronous orbit, it will remain parked there forever, never spiralling inward to form a ring or being thrown outward to crash into the other moons.
